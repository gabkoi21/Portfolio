<!-- Taileindcss Responsive Designed -->

Well in tailwind there are five breakpoint

<!-- sm, lg, xl, or 2xl -->

So in Tailwind the classes that do not have the

<!-- Breakpoint is call unprefixed  -->

while the classes that has the

 <!-- breakpoint is known as the prefixed   -->

These are keytips of how breakpoint works

1<!-- Donâ€™t use sm: to target mobile devices -->
2<!-- Use unprefixed utilities to target mobile, and override them at larger breakpoints -->

<!-- So if you do not want to used the  md:mx-20 you can used the conatiainer  -->

Benefits:
Responsive Layout: The container class automatically handles responsiveness for the div.
Cleaner Code: Eliminates the need for explicit margin utilities (mx-\*) by leveraging Tailwind's built-in container system.
